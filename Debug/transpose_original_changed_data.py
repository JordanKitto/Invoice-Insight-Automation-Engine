# 1. ior_changed_sample.csv → first 10 rows in the old IOR structure
# 2. pior_changed_sample.csv → first 10 rows in the new PIOR structure

# Goal - Take the IOR sample, transform it into the PIOR shape (columns + structure), and visually compare it with the PIOR sample until you’re happy. Then we can generalise to the full IOR file.
